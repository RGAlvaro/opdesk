# Project State

Last updated: 2026-07-08

This file is the compact operational state for agents. Use it to orient quickly before reading detailed specs, ADRs, implementation history, or code.

## Current Work

- Active branch: `codex/spec-201-background-jobs`
- Active spec: `SPEC-201`
- Current state: `SPEC-201` is review approved locally after addressing the assignment-version stale job review feedback. It adds Redis/Celery background jobs, task assignment notification enqueueing, a local-safe logging notification adapter, backend tests, and local/production Compose worker wiring.
- Documentation checkpoint: agent operational memory was restructured on 2026-06-16 with this file, central touch-to-spec routing, per-spec scope/context blocks, and `ADR-005`; on 2026-06-24 the base workflow added review-gated memory checks and implementation-log scaffolding targets; `ADR-009` records the managed-sandbox GitHub CLI policy
- Recent validation recorded in `docs/implementation-log.md`: `SPEC-201` review fix passed `make verify-no-db`, `make smoke`, elevated `make migrations-check`, focused re-review tests, memory check, and whitespace check on 2026-07-08 after the earlier 2026-07-07 production smoke baseline passed.
- Current validation baseline: `SPEC-201` background jobs and worker/Redis Compose wiring pass the no-DB verification harness, local Docker smoke, production Compose config, production smoke, and PostgreSQL migration drift checks.

## Next Handoff

- Next role: Ingeniero de software for integration handoff
- Next likely integration work: commit, push, and open/merge review-approved `SPEC-201` work.
- Keep `SPEC-301` production docs aligned if future scheduled jobs or a Celery beat service are added.

## Implemented Specs

| Spec | Scope | Primary surfaces | Latest state |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SPEC-010` | Backend scaffold, local PostgreSQL, Alembic, Make harness | `backend/`, `docker-compose.yml`, `Makefile`, `.env.example` | Implemented and approved through later validation |
| `SPEC-011` | Local Adminer database inspection | `docker-compose.yml`, `.env.example`, `README.md`, harness docs | Implemented and review approved |
| `SPEC-101` | Backend auth and users | `backend/app`, `backend/tests`, Alembic migration `0002`, `.env.example` | Implemented and review approved after endpoint-level API tests |
| `SPEC-002` | Human-readable code comments and initial comment pass | Existing backend/frontend source files, future source changes | Implemented and review approved |
| `SPEC-104` | React app shell and auth/profile UI | `frontend/`, `Makefile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `.env.example`, `README.md` | Implemented, reviewed, and merged locally to `main` |
| `SPEC-102` | Single-owner organizations, ownership transfer, permanent deletion, and RBAC | Organization backend, migrations `0003`/`0004`, tests, `ADR-007` | Implemented and review approved |
| `SPEC-103` | Projects and tasks backend | Project/task backend, migration `0005`, endpoint tests | Implemented and review approved |
| `SPEC-105` | Frontend organizations UI | Organization routes, shell navigation, organization API hooks, frontend tests | Implemented and review approved |
| `SPEC-106` | Frontend projects and tasks UI | Project/task routes, forms, filters, pagination, assignment UI, frontend tests | Implemented and review approved |
| `SPEC-201` | Background jobs and notifications | Redis/Celery worker, task assignment notification enqueueing, logging adapter, Compose wiring, `ADR-010` | Implemented and review approved locally |
| `SPEC-301` | Production deployment and operations | Production Compose, Caddy, CI, isolated smoke, deployment docs, tested backup/restore, `ADR-008` | Implemented and review approved |

## Draft Specs

None currently.

## Next Likely Work

1. Commit and publish the review-approved `SPEC-201` implementation.
2. Add Playwright coverage in a dedicated follow-up when E2E work is prioritized.
3. Execute the documented VPS/domain deployment when public launch work is prioritized.

## Known Gaps

- `SPEC-104` has no Playwright E2E tests yet; the spec intentionally recommends adding them after the frontend/local server harness stabilizes.
- `SPEC-106` has route-level/component coverage but still has no Playwright E2E critical path; the spec recommends adding Playwright after organization/project/task UI stabilizes.
- Public production deployment is documented but not yet executed against a real VPS/domain.
- `SPEC-201` uses a log-only notification adapter; real email delivery, notification inbox UI, scheduled jobs, and persistent job audit remain outside this spec.

## Validation Baseline

- Latest recorded review-fix validation for `SPEC-201`: `make verify-no-db` PASS with 71 backend non-DB tests and 38 frontend tests, `make smoke` PASS with Redis `PONG` and worker running, and elevated `make migrations-check` PASS on 2026-07-08. A full `make verify` rerun on 2026-07-08 passed no-DB checks but failed at migrations before Compose PostgreSQL was started; the subsequent smoke plus elevated migration check covered the failed step.
- Latest `SPEC-201` review decision: APPROVED on 2026-07-08 after focused stale-version worker test, memory check, and whitespace check passed.
- Latest recorded full local verification for `SPEC-201`: elevated `make verify` PASS on 2026-07-07; earlier sandboxed `make migrations-check` failed due localhost PostgreSQL access and the elevated rerun passed.
- Latest `SPEC-201` Compose validation: `make prod-config` PASS; `make smoke` PASS with Redis `PONG` and worker running; sandboxed `make prod-smoke` FAIL due Docker socket access, elevated `make prod-smoke` PASS, elevated `make prod-down` PASS on 2026-07-07.
- Latest recorded full local verification: `make verify` PASS for `SPEC-301` on 2026-06-30, run with elevated host PostgreSQL access after the sandboxed migration step failed to connect to localhost.
- Latest review-fix validation: `make prod-config`, `make prod-smoke`, `make prod-down`, `make smoke`, `make migrations-check-compose`, `make verify-no-db`, `npm run build` from `frontend/`, URL-encoded SQLAlchemy URL parse check, `make memory-check SPEC=SPEC-301`, and `git diff --check` PASS on 2026-07-06. The pushed GitHub Actions run then passed the complete `make verify` harness with PostgreSQL at commit `2a36558`.
- Latest recorded sandbox-friendly frontend validation: `make test-frontend`, `make lint`, `make format-check`, and `make typecheck` PASS for `SPEC-106` pagination review fix on 2026-06-30.
- Latest recorded smoke check: isolated `make prod-smoke` and `make prod-down` PASS for the completed `SPEC-301` review fix on 2026-07-02.
- Latest final review: `SPEC-301` APPROVED on 2026-07-06 after re-review of production database URL handling, full CI migration coverage, production/local Docker smoke, backup/restore smoke, validation evidence, ADR, and project memory.
- Memory harness baseline: `make memory-check SPEC=SPEC-301` verifies that project memory mentions the active spec and that the newest implementation-log entry includes required handoff sections.
- Use `specs/harness/local-validation.md` for current command meanings and expected coverage.
